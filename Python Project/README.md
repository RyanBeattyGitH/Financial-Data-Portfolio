# Nikkei 225 Price Prediction

## Description
This project analyzes daily price data from the Nikkei 225 index from May 1, 1965, to October 20, 2023. Using Anaconda3 and Jupyter Notebook, I preprocessed the data and implemented a simple linear regression model to predict future prices based on the historical data.

## Technologies Used
- Anaconda
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Source
