## Summary of Findings
- The dataset covers daily prices from May 1, 1965, to October 20, 2023.
- Visualizations indicate an overall upward trend in the Nikkei 225 index.
- The linear regression model predicts future prices based on historical data from October 20, 2023 to October 20, 2024.

## Predictions
- The model shows reasonable accuracy in predicting a general rise in prices within the tested range.
- Future work could include improving the model with more features or using more advance machine learning algorithms to help it account for the major price spikes and drops that can skew the data.
